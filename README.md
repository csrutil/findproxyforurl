# FindProxyForURL

### ü§îWhy
I am a SwitchyOmega addict, so I need to setup lots of the proxy clauses. it's kind of mess. So I create the project, 
it will create the proxy automatically.


### üìçWhere is it
I ship it to the heroku, you can check the code base by yourself


### How to run the project

```ruby
$ git clone https://github.com/csrutil/findproxyforurl
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rackup config.ru -p 8080
```

### How do I use it

Assume your SOCKS5 proxy run on host 10.0.50.185 port 7891, you can create a Profile and just put the link into the input area. then click the Download button

```js
https://findproxyforurl.herokuapp.com?host=10.0.50.185&port=7891
```
